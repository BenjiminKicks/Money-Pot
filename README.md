<h2>Money-Pot</h2> 
Money-Pot is a free grocery budgeting web application that helps users manage grocery spending, track purchases, collaborate under a shared budget, discover deals and coupons, and access free food resources. It is designed especially for college students, roommates, couples, and low-income users who need a clear, reliable way to manage shared grocery expenses.
This repository represents the ongoing development of Money-Pot.

<h2>🧩 Problem Statement</h2>
Grocery budgeting is a major source of stress in shared households. Many people—especially college students—rely on verbal agreements or loose planning when splitting grocery costs. This often leads to:
Overspending
Confusion over who paid for what
Financial stress and arguments
Poor visibility into shared expenses
At the same time, low-income and food-insecure individuals face additional challenges in finding affordable groceries and accessing free food resources.
Money-Pot solves this by providing a centralized, transparent, and collaborative grocery budgeting system.

</ul><br>  

<h3>Secondary Users<h3>
<ul>
<li>Low-income households</li>
<li>Food-insecure individuals</li>

<h2>🛠️ Current MVP Status</h2>
The current MVP focuses on establishing the backend foundation:
Flask-based web application
CRUD functionality for budget entries
SQLAlchemy ORM with a relational database
Server-side routing (GET/POST)
Dynamic rendering with Jinja2
Deployed web app for testing real-world behavior




<h2>⚠️ Known Limitation & Key Learning</h2>
During deployment, a critical issue was discovered:
budget data entered by one user was visible to others using the same deployed app.
This highlighted an important architectural lesson:
Shared state exists without authentication
User-specific data must be scoped correctly
Authentication and session management are essential for real-world apps
This insight directly informs the next development phase:
user accounts, authentication, and true shared-budget groups.



<h2>🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far</h2>
How shared data behaves in deployed web applications
Why authentication is critical for privacy and trust
How MVPs expose real architectural flaws
How to debug logical and system-level issues
How product requirements influence backend design
